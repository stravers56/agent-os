Now that you've created this product's mission.md, use that to guide your creation of the roadmap in `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` by following these instructions:

{{workflows/planning/create-product-roadmap}}

## Display confirmation and next step

Once you've created roadmap.md, output the following message:

```
âœ… I have documented the product roadmap at `agent-os/product/roadmap.md`.

Review it to ensure it aligns with how you see this product roadmap going forward.

Next step: Run the command, `4-create-tech-stack.md`
```

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure the product roadmap is ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's preferences and standards as detailed in the following files:

{{standards/global/*}}
