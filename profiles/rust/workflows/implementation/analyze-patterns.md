Identify and take note of existing design patterns and reuseable code or components that you can use or model your implementation after.

Search for specific design patterns and/or reuseable components as they relate to YOUR **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Use the following to guide your search for existing patterns:

1. Check `spec.md` for references to codebase areas that the current implementation should model after or reuse.
2. Check the referenced files under the heading "User Standards & Preferences" (listed below).

State the patterns you want to take note of and then follow these patterns in your implementation.
