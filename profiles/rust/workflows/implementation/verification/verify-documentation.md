Check `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/implementations` folder to confirm that each task group from this spec's `tasks.md` has an associated implementation document that is named using the number and title of the task group.

For example, if the 3rd task group is titled "Commenting System", then the implementer of that task group should have already created an implementation document named `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/implementations/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

If documentation is missing for any task group, include this in your final verification report.
