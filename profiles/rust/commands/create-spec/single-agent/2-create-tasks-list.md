Now that we've documented the spec.md, please break down the spec into an actionable tasks list with strategic grouping and ordering, by following these instructions:

{{workflows/specification/create-tasks-list}}

## Display confirmation and next step

Display the following message to the user:

```
The tasks list has created at `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`.

Review it closely to make sure it all looks good.

Next step: Run the command, `3-verify-spec.md`.

Or if want, you can skip straight to running the `implement-spec.md` command.
```

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the tasks list is ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's preferences and standards as detailed in the following files:

{{standards/*}}
