This begins a multi-step process for planning a new spec for our next product initiative.

The FIRST STEP is to initialize the spec by following these instructions:

{{workflows/specification/initialize-spec}}

## Display confirmation and next step

Once you've initialized the spec folder, output the following message (replace `[this-spec]` with the folder name for this spec)

```
âœ… I have initialized the spec folder at `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]`.

Next step: Run the command, 2-research-spec.md
```
